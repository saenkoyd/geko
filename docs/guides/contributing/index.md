#### Geko

1. Clone the Geko repo: https://github.com/geko-tech/geko

3. Select the Geko target.
4. In the Scheme settings, in Run action, under Options find Working Directory field, set the path to the project you will be generating with Geko.

#### Debug

To debug, you can use your own projects or the ready-made fixtures located in the fixtures/ folder.

Fixtures are pre-configured demo projects in various setups used for debugging and testing.

To debug using a specific fixture, go to Scheme > Run Action > Options > Working Directory and set the path to that fixture.

#### Debug commands

To debug a certain function you need to set an argument. A list of all arguments is available when running without arguments. For assistance and help, use the option -h.

To set an argument go to Scheme > Run Action > Arguments > Arguments Passed on launch.
